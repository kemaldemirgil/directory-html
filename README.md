# HTML Directory

## Description:
This directory, which includes most of `HTML5`, is a collection of the syntax used in the language. It will be used for further referencing, and it'll be staying up to date with the most recent version.

## Notes:
I've added the base structure and important aspects of the language but, it does not include %100 everything about `HTML5`.
Certain aspects connected with `HTML`, will be added using `CSS` and `JavaScipt` in the further directories.
For now, this is pure vanilla HTML5...

## Improvements:
Please contact me for any ideas & additional content that could be added...
